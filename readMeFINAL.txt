If you don't make a list , the computer wont be able to undertsand what you are trying to tell it! Its better to create a list, and sort it, for the program to be able to read it. If you didn't follow the instructions you are suppose to follow, your program can go wrong, or you can have an error in it. However if you did follow the instructions, you program will function unless you made a mistake.
2. In Binary search you will first need to write a function. A function with an x, I think. Also Binary search has to do with sorting lists, and making one to. Thats why making a list is such an important part of the progarm. For the elements in Binary, the elements need to be sorted in lists when you are doing a binary search. The reason recursive algorithm use recursion its so the computer can understand the statment, you are trying to make. Literative algorithm, also can help with the statment your making, except instead of understanding it, it has to do something with a "loop"
3. You can make your program better by adding things you think will fit in the code you are making. In my code I made, I added something simple, I am experience at coding, but it is still diffcult into this day to undertsand how to do everything. Their is a lot of things you can do to your code to make it better, Its really up to you, but I do recommend adding a List and sorting it, it will make it better.
For example: https://github.com/StarFc/Listappv3.py/blob/main/Listappv3.py. If you open this link, you can see a code we worked on in class. It shows a function I tried to make and also even the lsit, and sorted list I was talking about.
